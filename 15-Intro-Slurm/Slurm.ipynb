    "# HPC resource manager: Slurm\n",
    "\n",
    "Slurm, <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>, is a resource\n",
    "manager and job scheduler that allows to organize and share resources in\n",
    "a HPC environment to get an optimal usage. It allows to specify usage\n",
    "policies, limits in terms of memory or cpu etc, to get metrics regarding\n",
    "the cluster usage, and so on. You can watch a good intro at\n",
    "<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_Fb7X6Db0> and related videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use a very simple installation in the computer room. Our\n",
    "goal will be to learn some of the basic commands to get the possible\n",
    "resources, how to specify a partition, limits, resources and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, log into a client and use the command `sinfo` to get\n",
    "information about partitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "sinfo --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in this example, there are several partitions available\n",
    "to be used. The `2threads` partition is the default. Some nodes\n",
    "(`sala31`) are not working. There is not time limit besides the login\n",
    "node (which actually should not be used for any job). Use the manual and\n",
    "get some other info about the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's run some simple commands in the cluster. To do so, we will use\n",
    "the simple command `srun` (check the manual)\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "srun hostname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see here, the command actually ran in the `2threads`\n",
    "partition since we did not specify the actual partitions and `2threads`\n",
    "is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Run 18 instances of the same command in a non-default\n",
    "partition. You should get something like (`12threads` partition)\n",

    "necessary to run 18 processes (each node allows for 12 processes, two\n",
