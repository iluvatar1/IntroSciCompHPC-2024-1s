    "# Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "After debugging your code and writing several tests to avoid repeating\n",
    "the same bug, you want to start optimizing it to make it fast (but\n",
    "keeping it correct). To do this, you need to measure. You need to detect\n",
    "functions which take most of the time. Optimizing a function that takes\n",
    "only 5% of the time will give you only marginal benefits. Finding the\n",
    "functions that take most of the time is called profiling , and there are\n",
    "several tools ready to help you. In the following we ill learn to use\n",
    "these tools to detect the hotspots/bottlenecks in our codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why profile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling allows you to learn how the computation time was spent and how\n",
    "the data flows in your program. This can be achieved by just printing\n",
    "the time spent on each section using some internal timers, or, better,\n",
    "by using a tool called \"profiler\" that shows you how time was spent in\n",
    "your program and which functions called which other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a profiler is something that comes very handy when you want to\n",
    "verify that your program does what you want it to do, especially when it\n",
    "is not easy to analyze (it may contain many functions or many calls to\n",
    "different functions and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, WE ARE SCIENTISTS, so we want to profile code to optimize the\n",
    "computation time taken by our program. The key idea then becomes finding\n",
    "where (which function/subroutine) is the computation time spent and\n",
    "attack it using optimization techniques (studied in a previous session\n",
    "of this course, check\n",
    "[this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z71cz13fzce05x7/UsualOptimization.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring elapsed time\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is to just add timers to your code. This is a good\n",
    "practice and it is useful for a code to report the time spent on\n",
    "different parts. The following example is extracted from\n",

    "\n",
    "Valgrind allows not only to debug a code but also to profile it. Here we\n",
    "will see how to use cachegrind, to check for cache misses, and\n",
    "callgrind, for a calling graph much like tools like perf and gprof.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache checker : cachegrind\n",
    "\n",
    "> From\n",
    "> [cachegrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html#cg-manual.overview)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` bash\n",
    "> Cachegrind simulates how your program interacts with a machine's\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> cache hierarchy and (optionally) branch predictor. It simulates a\n",
    "> machine with independent first-level instruction and data caches (I1\n",
    "> and D1), backed by a unified second-level cache (L2). This exactly\n",
    "> matches the configuration of many modern machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, some modern machines have three levels of cache. For these\n",
    "> machines (in the cases where Cachegrind can auto-detect the cache\n",
    "> configuration) Cachegrind simulates the first-level and third-level\n",
    "> caches. The reason for this choice is that the L3 cache has the most\n",
    "> influence on runtime, as it masks accesses to main memory.\n",
    "> Furthermore, the L1 caches often have low associativity, so simulating\n",
    "> them can detect cases where the code interacts badly with this cache\n",
    "> (eg. traversing a matrix column-wise with the row length being a power\n",
    "> of 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Therefore, Cachegrind always refers to the I1, D1 and LL (last-level)\n",
