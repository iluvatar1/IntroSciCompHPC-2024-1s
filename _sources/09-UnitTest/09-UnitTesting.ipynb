    "correct way, at least for the cases one is testing. Once a function is\n",
    "written (or even before in TTD) or a bug is fixed, it is necessary to\n",
    "write a test that ensures the function to work properly in limit cases\n",
    "or the bug to not reappear in the future. There are several levels\n",
    "associated with [unit testing\n",

    "of tools to implement very basic tests, althoguh the list of [testing\n",
    "frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks)\n",
    "is very large. Furthermore, modularization will be very important, so\n",
    "you must have a clear understanding on how to split some given code into\n",
    "headers, source files, and how to compile objects and then link them\n",
    "using the linker, hopefully through a Makefile.\n",

    "Our goal here is to learn to use\n",
    "[catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#top)\n",
    "to test a very simple function extracted from their tutorial. Later we\n",
    "will modularize the code to practice that and write a useful `Makefile`.\n",
