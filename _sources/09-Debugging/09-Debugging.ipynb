    "using `-g3` (or `-ggdb3`). Default is 2. Level 3 allows for debugging fo\n",
    "preprocessor macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you run your code\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "$ ./gdb_example_01.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you will get the original output. The code does not have any error, and\n",
    "in principle it does not need debugging. But, you can still use the\n",
    "debugger to explore what your \"correct\" code is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To attach `gdb` to your executable, run gdb as\n",

    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "int a;\n",
    "```\n",

    "this point? 0? 1? Let's check\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "(gdb) print a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value should be poor memory garbage, like 0xff2345 or similar. It\n",
    "depends on the machine. Now, if we move one step to the next line in the\n",
    "execution order\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",

    "(gdb) print a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
